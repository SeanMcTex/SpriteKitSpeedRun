Code for my talk "Speed Run: Build a Galaxian Clone with SpriteKit in 45 Minutes"

SpriteKit is a terrific new 2D game engine that Apple gave developers with iOS 7. In this crash 
course, we'll build a clone of the classic arcade game Galaxian in a mere 45 minutes. We'll see 
not only how to create and use sprites, but also take advantage of SpriteKit's sound effects, 
particle editor and generator, and physics engine. And when we're done creating the game on iOS, 
for extra credit we'll build it for the Mac too with almost no extra code.
